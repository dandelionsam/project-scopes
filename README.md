# Project Scopes

## What it is

Project Scopes, aka `project-scopes` is a simple package which generates a scopes file for your commit messages.
The aim is to generate a file called `SCOPES.md` crawling in the top directory of your project and generate a list of all the folders that you have.
The idea behind this is that you can later use these generated scopes to improve your commit messages using conventional-commits.
